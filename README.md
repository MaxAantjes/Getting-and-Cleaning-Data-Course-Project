# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project
This project is my contribution to the Getting and Cleaning Data Course Project of the John Hopkins Data University Science Specialization. The code for generating a tidy data set can be found in the run.analysis.R file. Details on the raw data, variables and data summary choices can be found in the Code Book.md file.
